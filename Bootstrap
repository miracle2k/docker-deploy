# This install some base images that are required on the host, notably
# etcd and discoverd. They are special in that they provide service
# discovery, so they can't rely on it themselves. While discoverd needs
# etcd, the bigger challenge is that everything needs discoverd.
#
# There are only two options: DNS or host mapped ports, and DNS is harder
# to do and has the caching issue.
