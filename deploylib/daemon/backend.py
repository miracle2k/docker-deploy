"""While I am still deciding which direction this should go in, the backends
represent the most low-level abstraction dealing with containers.

The user's service definition (with its variables and inherited environment
variables) are converted to a flat ``runcfg``, which is essentially the final
docker configuration of a container.

The backend implementation takes the runcfg and, as the final link that we
have to docker, makes sure these containers get started.

Possible backends that I can imagine right now are:

- Pass runcfg as a job to flynn-host
- Pass runcfg as a job to flynn-controller (we might not have to manage
     multiple different hosts ourselves).
- Create CoreOS fleet service files, and invoke those.

    prepare(runcfg)
        A optional method called before start() that basically allows
        the backend to fail early, before the caller might start to
        shutdown any existing instances they might want to replace.

    start(runcfg) -> instance id
        Spin up an instance of the thing in runcfg.

    status(instance id)
        Is the instance up or down.

    terminate(instance id)
        Remove the instance.

    This design is flexible enough to allow a supervisor based backend to
    choose whether a service instance should be kept up by way of
    restarting the same container (i.e. an instance is mapped to a single
    docker container), or by using 'docker run' to create a new container
    every time the instance comes up.
