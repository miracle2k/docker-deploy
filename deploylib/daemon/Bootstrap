# This installs some base images that are required on the host, notably
# etcd and discoverd. Later, flynn-host bootstrapping may take care of
# this instead.
#
# These services are special in that they provide service discovery itself,
# so they can't rely on it themselves.
#
# While discoverd needs etcd, the bigger challenge is that everything
# needs discoverd.
#
# There are only two options: DNS or host mapped ports, and DNS is harder
# to do and has the caching issue.
