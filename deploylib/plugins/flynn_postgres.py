"""This plugin is specifically to setup databases with the
flynn-postgres appliance.

Here is my thought process on initializing database resources:

1. In principal, we specifically chose a design where containers interact only
   through service discovery; the order in which they are started does not
   matter.

2. However, for initializing something like a database resource that requires
   passwords, we have to fundamentally introduce a ordered step.

3. The only possible scenario where this is not required is when the database
   initialization "dissolves" entirely within the container setup, that is,
   the database container only registers with discovery when it has
   initialized itself with auth data that is known to us beforehand.

   (It's not feasible to write a web app in such a way that it can deal with
   a database server being available but waiting for the actual database
   configuration to be setup).

4. So I don't see an alternative to having an ordered "bootstrap" step. This
   step would be required to run before any containers do, and further may
   force particular containers to be started before others.

   This means that once a deployment is initialized, the containers will
   subsequently still be entirely independent from each other.


We should support the following different approaches to setting up a database:

- The case described above: Setting up the database via an initialization
  step.

- This includes cases where the database container itself may generate the
  auth information and exposes it via the filesystem for example.

- A database container which has the setup step builtin: Taking the
  user/pw/name data via env and registering with discovery when done.

- For cases where all else fails, maybe because we are working with a backend
  where we cannot start the db container ourselves, we should make it as
  simple as possible to get manual user interaction involved to do the
  initialization.

This plugin uses a global Flynn-Postgres section::

    Flynn-Postgres:
        in: db-api
        expose_as: POSTGRES_
        id: foobar

    Flynn-Postgres:
        foobar:
            expose_as: POSTGRES_
            id: foobar

``in`` is the flynn/postgres API service to use. ``expose_as`` is the
environment variable prefix to use. These variables like ``POSTGRES_HOST``
will be available to all containers, so it works perfectly if multiple
containers depend on it. An dict structure can be used for multiple
databases. The key is used to allow renaming the ``expose_as`` option
w/o triggering a new setup.
