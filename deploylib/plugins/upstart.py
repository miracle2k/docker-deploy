"""This is designed to run services using upstart, mostly intended for
a single-host setup.

Services will hook themselves as "start on docker-deploy", so when your
base system is ready, raise this event.

Apart from creating an upstart file for each service, it also creates one
for each deployment. That is, you'll be able to say::

    initctl start my-deployment

And all the service instances within that deployment will come up.
