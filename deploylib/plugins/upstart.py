"""A collection of plugins that make up the Upstart backend.

This includes the actual backend implementation, but also plugins that
write upstart files for the system services, and upstart files to control
a whole deployment at once.

That is, you'll be able to say::

    initctl start my-deployment

And all the service instances within that deployment will come up.

The specific dependencies look like the following:

<- means "on starting" / before
-> means "on start"/ after

For start::

             -- boot
             |
    root <- etcd -> discoverd
      |                    -> shelf     -> root
      |                    -> strowger  -> root
      -> a deployment -> all deployment services

For stop::

    root <-> etcd -> discoverd -> deployment -> all deployment services
                      |
            shelf  <-------> strowger
