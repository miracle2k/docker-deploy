"""sdutil is a command line client for discoverd-based service discovery.

This plugin makes it easy to add service discovery to your containers by:

1) Injecting the sdutil binary into containers
2) Rewriting the command line so that sdutil is used.

sdutil can both register your service, as well as consume other services
for you. In both cases, it wraps your actual executable. When consuming
other services, it will provide the addresses of the service you require
via environment variables, and it will start your executable only once
all dependencies are available, and will restart whenever the leader
of a service changes.

Here is an example::

    foo:
        ports: [a, b, c]
        sdutil:
            register: true
            expose:
                bar: BAR

``register`` will cause all ports of the service to be registered with
discoverd; under names like ``deploy_id:foo:a``. ``expose`` will wait
for ``bar`` to be available (``deploy_id:bar``), and put the address
into the environment variable ``BAR``.

If the unnamed default port is used, it will register as
``deploy_id:foo``.

If your container already contains sdutil and you do not want the plugin
to build a new image to include it, you can specify the ``binary`` key::

    foo:
        sdutil:
            register: true
            binary: /bin/sdutil



Plugin configuration
--------------------

The environment variable ``SDUTIL_URL`` can be used to change where the
binary that is inserted comes from. If not specified, an internet location
is used.
